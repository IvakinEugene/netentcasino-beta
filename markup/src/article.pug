						p As Christmas fast approaches, it’s time to take a look at the new online casinos which have impressed us enough of late to warrant your attention. We analyse every little detail of a new platform before bringing them to the table, with all kinds of aspects overseen – seen within our NetEnt casino reviews.
						p So, with everyone getting into the festive spirit, let’s take a look at December 2017’s best new casinos – with juicy welcome packages a given!

						p And what a way to kick things off – Highroller Casino! We don’t exactly gush over new casino domains regularly, however we had to make an exception with Highroller (not High Roller) Casino due to the quality on show. You can see the entirety of our reasoning within the Highroller Casino review, but here’s a quick snapshot:
						ul
							li Pretty much every available NetEnt slot/game to play
							li A richly rewarding storyline which sees you progress through a fictional metropolis
							li Steal coins from fellow players in exchange for spins!
							li Seamless availability on both mobile and desktop
							li An entire 24/7 “backup” help team for your convenience
						p As 2018 is set to be saturated with more speculation about the possibilities of technology in iGaming, it’s refreshing to see a platform focussed more on the experience of now.

							strong Grab your 200% up to €100 + 50 free spins welcome bonus from Highroller Casino!
