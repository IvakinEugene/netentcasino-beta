						p Success and profit in the game of online blackjack come from applying the right techniques at the right time. While easy and simple tactics tend to work in low limit blackjack games, you will need to be more familiar with more advanced techniques in order to make it in more difficult competitions. Read on to learn more.
						h2 Taking online blackjack to the next level

						p Applying more advanced online blackjack strategies is possible once you have mastered the basics. These include knowing when to double down, playing hard or soft hands as well as splitting amongst many others. Without knowing the meaning of these terms or else knowing when to apply them, you won’t be able to apply more high-level strategies.
						p To begin with, you need to remember that each option you have in hand has an average win or loss attached to it. Imagine you are surrendering or doubling with a hard 20 against the dealer’s upcard depicting a 5. This would result in a low payout compared to standing.
						p For the opportunity to improve, you first need to get rid of all common mistakes especially when you have big margins. You need to work harder when you have smaller margins.
						p To move on to the next level, you first need to know when to hit and when to stand especially when the dealer’s upcard is considerably weak. You first have to come up with your own general rules that will aid you with which type of play you should be making.  Come up with your own rules which can be applied when you know the dealer’s card as well as your own total to make a wise decision. You can then proceed to either hit, doubling, splitting or standing.
						h2 Play multiple hands in moderation
						//- 
						p When pro online blackjack players play multiple hands at the table, they are doing it to inject some fun into the game. Playing two hands at the same time increases your chances of winning since you are placing two bets instead of one.
						p It is similar to playing one hand after the other but you’re doing it in one go. Don’t be tempted to play multiple hands continuously though, as otherwise, you are just doubling the total you bet on each round. It can end up costing you big especially if you have a smaller bankroll.

						h1 Strategy for online blackjack tournaments
						//- 
						p When you join an online blackjack tournament, having just a pinch of knowledge about tournament strategy can increase your chances of success twofold.

						h2 Same outcome for all players
						//- 
						p One of the most defining characteristics of an online blackjack tournament is that all players in the tournament are competing against the same dealer. This means that players would have the same outcomes on any given hand round. For example, if the dealer draws a blackjack, all the players at the table would have the same result, most likely a loss.

							p One of the most defining characteristics of an online blackjack tournament is that all players in the tournament are competing against the same dealer.
						p Knowing a good basic strategy is the way forward for you to secure yourself tournament success. If you are planning on limiting the risk by betting little on most hands, then mistakes won’t end up costing you much. If, on the other hand, you are aiming to place big bets, playing incorrectly will end up costing you quite a bit.
						p Once you run out of money during a blackjack tournament, you are unable to buy more chips for a second chance.
						h2 Take care of your bankroll
						//- 
						p One of the ways you could minimise risk is by bet sizing. Smaller bets can reduce and even eliminate completely your chance of ruin at the table. You need to choose your battles wisely. These days, it would be best to base your decision on strategy on how shy or bold your opponents appear to be. If all your competitors are making small bets, it would be quite smart to make a large bet early on. If there are few bold bettors at the table, it would be best to bet just enough to maximise your bankroll you are risking.
						p By making small bets on a regular basis with a few opportunities to make bigger bets, you can fight both styles of players at the table. Since most blackjack tournaments see a mix of both timid and bold betters, this gives you the chance to carefully pick hands where a large bet would be most opportune.
						p During a mid-round, you should be assessing the bets of all your opponents before opting for a bet size so you can properly assess the bet amount to give you a lead without risking too many chips. Once you are in the lead, you should keep in mind the similar outcomes rule. Making smaller bets when you’re in the lead gives your opponents the chance to surpass you. Although you will still come across poor cards and will occasionally be surpassed, the trick is to risk a medium-sized bet to match the players who are ahead.
						p This means that picking your battles and not placing unnecessary large bets would be wise. Players who are consistently placing medium-sized bets on most of the hands are at a severe disadvantage as their bankroll depletes. The bets individually do not give you a lead but can collectively affect your bankroll. The best way forward is to use a mix of small and large bets. If you are placing a medium-sized bet, it would have to be for one of two reasons: Either you are in the lead or else your bet is big enough to help you accomplish a pertaining goal.
						p The great thing about online blackjack is that there are plenty of betting systems and other strategies in existence that can help increase your chances of winning. No matter what game you are playing, someone somewhere has developed the perfect betting strategy. There are ultimately two betting strategies that each player should take up when playing online blackjack.

						p Before we dive into the topic of betting strategies, you should set up a bankroll before you join a blackjack table, whether online or offline. As has been mentioned before, the game of blackjack is meant to be fun but these betting strategies require a considerable bankroll for you to follow and make a neat profit.
						h2 The Martingale Blackjack Betting System
						//- 
						p One of the oldest betting systems around, originating in 18th century France, the original theory stated that a player who is considerably wealthy could prevent a loss in even money bets by doubling each bet each time he lost. It was originally used for roulette, but it has since been used for a number of games as well as the stock market trading.
